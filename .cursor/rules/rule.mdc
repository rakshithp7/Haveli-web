# Rules

- 🔒 Only perform actions (edits, suggestions, completions) if you are **at least 95% confident** in the outcome.
- ❓ If confidence is **below 95%**, **pause** and ask the user for clarification.
- 🤖 Do **not make assumptions** — better to ask questions than to proceed with low certainty.
- 🚫 Avoid **overengineering**. Always prefer the **simplest and most efficient solution** that meets the requirement.
- 🧹 Do **not write redundant, unnecessary, or bloated code**. Keep logic clean and minimal.
- ✅ Always follow **industry-standard best coding practices**, including:
  - Clear naming conventions
  - Code readability and maintainability
  - Efficient use of data structures and algorithms
  - Comments only when helpful (avoid noise)
- 📣 If unsure whether to optimize, refactor, or add new code, **ask the user first**.
